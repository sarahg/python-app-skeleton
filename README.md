# Using The Skeleton # 

Whenever you want to start a new project, just do this:

- Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
- Rename (move) the NAME module to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
- Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project.
- Rename tests/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name.
- Double check it's all working using nosetests again.
- Start coding.
